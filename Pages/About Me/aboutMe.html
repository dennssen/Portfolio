        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Dennis Thomassen also known as Dennssen online, an aspiring game developer and VR enthusiast from
            Norway. I began programming at 14, creating a Discord bot to streamline the scheduling process for my VR
            esports team. The feeling of failing over and over but still managing to succeed in the end really sparked
            my passion for software development. <br> <br> Since then, I've focused on game development in Unity,
            experimenting with genres from platformers to VR prototypes. While many of my projects remain prototypes,
            each one has significantly helped me with project management and improving my general programming knowledge.
            My goal is to create immersive, player-focused experiences, whether that's through a huge open world VR
            adventure or an incredibly rewarding game mechanic.</p>
