                    AsteroidMiner is an incredibly simple game that i made in about a week as part of an assignement i
                    got when i was visiting TietoEvry card services for 2 weeks. <br> <br>

                    The assignement was given to me to try and challenge me with how object oriented programming worked,
                    however at that time i had already become very comfortable with OOP. I still found the assignement a
                    learning experience as it was the first time i used a game engine that did not come with a GUI for
                    placement of game objects or hitboxes.

                <p style="font-size: 40px; margin: 50px 25px">AsteroidMiner is a top-down survivor shooter rougelite
                    where you control a tiny spaceship that has to destroy and avoid asteroids. Breaking asteroids gives
                    you money that you can use to upgrade your ship for your next run. The game is heavily inspired by
                    Nodebuster.
