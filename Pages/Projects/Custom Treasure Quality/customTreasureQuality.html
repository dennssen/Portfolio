                    This mod started off as just a fun challenge for myself
                    and a mod i actually wanted but that i couldn't find, therefore i decided to make it myself. When my
                    friend mentioned he wanted the mod as well i figured i might as well upload it to the steam
                    workshop.
                    Suprisingly enough it gathered more traction than i expected, and i am very glad it did. <br> <br>

                    The Custom Treasure Quality mod was the first coding project i ever released to the public and my
                    first time working with user feedback and pushing out updates with patch notes. It
                    was also the first time i tried compatability with other mods such as the Mod config menu mod.<br>
                    <br>

                    This mod has helped me out more than i think it has towards where i am today.

                    Custom Treasure Quality is a mod that rerolls the item in the treasure room of the first floor until
                    it has a quality that is considered acceptable by the user. The default lowest value is 3 but with
                    the use of Mod config menu it can be whatever the user desires.
