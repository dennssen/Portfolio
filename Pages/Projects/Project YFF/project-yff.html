                    As the lead developer and only programmer in our group i made almost everything in game except for
                    the music and a couple of sprite concepts. I worked on the player movement, the gameplay, the level
                    selector, the saving system and so on. And because i had such massive amounts of influence on the
                    game the movement is heavily inspired by my favorite game ULTRAKILL with a tiny bit of Pizza Tower
                    for the gameplay. <br><br>

                    The gameplay goes as follows: <br>
                    You play as a robot designed to destroy spaceships. Using your utility of wall kicks, wall jumps,
                    slides and ground-pounds you run as fast as possible through these spaceships to get to and destroy
                    their core. As the core blows up when you run into it at 100m/s the entire ship changes structure
                    and you need to navigate backwards through a slightly modified version of the level you just played
                    before your time runs out and the ship explodes with you in it.

                <p style="font-size: 40px; margin: 50px 25px">Project YFF is an unreleased school project that i put
                    together with some of my classmates. The goal of the project was to create a playable demo of a game
                    with any genre that had a medium-low size. The game ended up becoming a fast-paced escape platformer
                    with 6 playable levels.
